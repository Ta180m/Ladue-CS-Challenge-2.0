xuxinwen: any of you know lisp

BigChonk: lisp is hard

unixkcd: relevant xkcd

unixkcd: https://xkcd.com/224/

BigChonk: is that why your username is unixkcd

unixkcd: yes

unixkcd: try going to https://uni.xkcd.com

xuxinwen: can you tell me what this program does?

xuxinwen:
;; Common Lisp

(defun g (a b)
    (if (> b 0) (g b (mod a b)) a)
)

(setq N 5)

(setq A ())
(loop for i from 0 to (- N 1)
    do (setq A (append A (list i)))
)

(setq ans 0)
(loop for i in A
    do (loop for j in A
        do (setq ans (+ ans (g i j)))
    )
)
(print ans)

unixkcd: too many parenthesis

BigChonk: i would rather paste it into an online lisp interpreter

BigChonk: than do it by hand

xuxinwen: good idea
